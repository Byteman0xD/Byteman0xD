Welcome to my blog, 

My name is Usman and i am an IT Security Professional currently working as a Security Operations Engineer. I deal with Cybersecurity Incidents on a daily basis, my major work involves threat hunting.

I am CCNP-Security, NSE4 and CEHv11 Certified. I plan to achieve the expert level certifications in the fiels of Network Security and Cybersecurity, currently working towards OSCP and CCIE.

This blog is a way of sharing back knowledge with the community, as i intend to populate my site with blogs related to:

* Network Security
* Cyber Security
* Protocol Deep-dives - by explaining RFCs in a short and simple way possible.
* Walkthroughs of challenges from different CTF platforms.

For any queries or suggestions or collaborations, reach me out at 'thebugcraft@gmail.com' OR you can also DM me on Linkedin (Link provided in the footer).

I hope you like my content.

Thank you.
