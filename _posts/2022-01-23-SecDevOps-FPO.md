SecDevOps - Firewall Policy Orchestration

Firewall automation projects are seemingly all the rage these days, with everyone looking to automate at least some portion of the process. Usually, the goal is to save time and money by automating firewall administration and policy management. However, these two categories have grown exponentially in scope and complexity in recent years, so automation projects often become much larger and time-consuming than originally intended and produce varied results.  In some less-than-stellar cases, they even collapse all together, and people revert to the original manual processes they were seeking to automate.

How can this situation be avoided? By taking a systematic and achievable approach to firewall automation using a combination of SecOps and DevOps.

Security Policy Orchestration is intelligent network change automation. It goes beyond simple task automation by truly understanding the network through simulation and analytics. It also gives security people an extra level of governance and control, which is so critical to assure security and business continuity.

DevOps has been a popular topic in IT circles over the past few years. DevOps is a software development method that aligns application development with IT operations. To fulfil on the vision of DevOps, IT has had to adopt a number of new tools and technologies. Some examples of these new tools are automation tools, containerization and orchestration platforms. 

The DevOps process is radically different than legacy processes, so it makes sense that IT departments would need new technologies to support this shift.
What about security, though? How has that changed? The fact is that security has lagged behind when it comes to enabling the transition to DevOps.

With traditional IT, development and deployment times can be long, and the security team has the time to harden security at the end of the development cycle. With DevOps, getting visibility into the possible security gaps before an application is launched is more complicated because there isn't the time to take weeks or months to ensure the security is hardened.

Automation is one of the cornerstones of DevOps, so it stands to reason that security also needs to be automated. Just when you thought DevOps was the new black, along comes SecDevOps. 

Now let’s discuss security automation and use a firewall change process as an example. 

One important attribute of SecDevOps is heavy use of security automation. A simple act of changing a firewall has huge potential for security automation.  The SecDevOps firewall change process goes beyond changing a few lines in a config, but also provides an independent and automated verification process that most organizations don’t perform today.
Corporate firewall management is increasingly complex due to an expanding network perimeter and the proliferation of cloud computing services. Gaps in effective firewall management delay business initiatives and lead to increasing security and compliance challenges.
Consider what happens when a firewall policy is changed.  First the policy change request is reviewed and approved.  Then the policy change request is assigned and acted upon.  Many times, but not always, the change is verified by another person through configuration review.

Security automation takes this process one step further.  Imagine when a firewall is changed that a security audit event is automatically logged.  Next, an automation component notices the firewall change and automatically spins up a remote scanning instance in a cloud provider.  Next, that scanning instance is contacted using APIs to perform a remote network scan.  The scan completes, results are exported and compared with prior scan results automatically.  

Finally, the automation component automatically updates the firewall change request in a ticketing system showing the scan results.  We have now completed an automatic, independent and autonomous firewall change verification.   That simplified yet powerful workflow is security automation and completes what many people refer to as a closed loop.

The collective impact of these developments on network and security operations tasks is having a profound impact on people, processes and technology, including DevOps groups, who like their Security Operations (SecOps) brethren, are under pressure to roll out services faster.
Being able to automatically generate, provision and synchronize Security Policy changes across a growing set of systems – with security, compliance and governance concerns accounted for – means that security will not become a bottleneck that slows down DevOps teams.

Contrary to popular belief, Security Policy Orchestration wasn’t created to restrict a company but to free it and help DevOps teams to accomplish its vision at the lowest IT risk level possible.  After all, there is no such thing as bulletproof security where the Internet is concerned. Instead, security folks will focus on reducing risk, which puts us in a much better position to add value to the business.  Plus,  since so many of today’s biggest threats (i.e. APTs, for example) are network-based, introducing the tenets of Security Policy Orchestration  – which literally automates best security practices into change processes – is in the mutual best interest of both SecOps and DevOps teams. 

One of the value propositions of using an orchestration solution is the time savings. By using a high level of automation to request, design and implement a change, the whole process can be reduced from a week or more to just a day or two.

Security policy orchestration is indicative of the maturity of the security policy management market, as well as the increasing complexity of network environments due to virtualization, cloud and IPv6. It’s no longer feasible for a network team to try to manage everything without a high level of automation,
